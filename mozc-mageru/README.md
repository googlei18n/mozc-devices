# Wired Version

## The spoon

Print the spoon under /third_party/mozc-mageru/spoon_stl/ using a 3D printer.
This is an example design of a flexible spoon that has a slot to embed a
flex sensor into.
We have tried it with PLA, but it will probably work with ABS as well.

## Electronic circuit

- Arduino Micro
- 22k-ohm resistor
- Flex sensor: FS-L-0055-253-ST (Spectra Symbol)

```
    Arduino Micro

         5V ---[22k ohm]-------+
                               |
         A5 -------------------+
                               |
        GND ---[Flex sensor]---+
```

## How to use the firmware

1. Open the sketch on Arduino IDE.
2. Choose "Arduino/Genuino Micro" in the [Tools]-[Board] menu.
3. If you are making Japanse-hiragana version, add ```#define JAPANESE_``` to the first line of the sketch
4. Upload to board.

## Sensor calibration

1. Open Serial Monitor.
2. Send '!' once to disable key output.
3. (the home position, which decides when to commit a character)
   Bend the sensor slightly and send '0'. Make sure the LED turns off when the spoon is not bent by external force.
4. (the position for the first letter)
   Bend the sensor slightly a bit more and send '1'.
5. (the position for the last letter)
   Bend the sensor to the end and send '2'.
6. Send 'w' to save the configuration to EEPROM.
7. Send '!' again to enable key output, or reset the device.

# Wireless Version

Coming soon.
